ThemeTest
==========

Documentation and Sketches for testing [Arduino](http://arduino.cc) IDE themes. Demonstrates all theme settings. Packaged as a library in order to define all possible keywords.


### Installation
- Download https://github.com/per1234/ThemeTest/archive/master.zip
- Using Arduino IDE 1.0.x:
  - **Sketch > Import Library... > Add Library... >** select the downloaded file **> Open**
- Using Arduino IDE 1.5+:
  - **Sketch > Include Library > Add ZIP Library... >** select the downloaded file **> Open**


### Editing the Arduino IDE's Theme
By editing a few files the appearance of the Arduino IDE can easily be modified to your liking. This can be useful for improving the visual accessibility or just for aesthetic purposes.

The theme files are located under a subfolder of the Arduino IDE installation folder.
- **Windows or Linux**: `lib/theme`
- **macOS**: `Contents/Resources/Java/lib/theme`

The Arduino IDE must be restarted before changes to the theme files take effect.

Note that a few other appearance-related settings are located in the Arduino's **File > Preferences** and also the file preference.txt, which may be found by clicking the link on the line under **File > Preferences > More preferences can be edited directly in the file**.
